   <marquee id="section1" direction="down"> <p>On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those
    that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who
    
    draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes 
    
    gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</p>

    <marquee direction="right">
      <p>
      <span id="a1">But</span> apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths.

      The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.

    <p>
      <span id="a1">before</span> I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and secretive — algorithms.
