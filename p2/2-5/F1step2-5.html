<h2><p> The web we have to save
by Hossein Derakhshan<br><br>
</h2>
    <p class="rotate">On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those<p>that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who <p>draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes <p>gazing at them any given time, web pages can capture <p>and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</p>

    <p>But apps like Instagram are blind — <br><p>or almost <p>blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant<p> to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into<p> quiet deaths.</p>

    <p>The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</p>

</div>

    before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed. Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, <p>and</p> most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, <p>reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.</p>

    <p>The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that’s <p>picked</p> for them by <p>complex –and secretive — algorithms.</P>
