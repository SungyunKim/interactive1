<h6> The <p>web</p> we have to save</p>
<p>By Hossein Derakhshan<br></p>
</h6>
    <h1><br><br><br>On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those<p> that have many eyes upon them. Just like celebrities who draw<p> a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing<p>at them any given time, web pages can capture and distribute <p>their power through hyperlinks.</p></h1>

<h2 class="rotate"
    
    
    <h8>But apps like Instagram are blind —or almost blind. Their gaze <p>goes nowhere except inwards, reluctant to transfer any of their vast <p>powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths.</p>
    The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</p></h8>

</div>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and secretive — algorithms.</P>
